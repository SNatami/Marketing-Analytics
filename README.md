2 datasets are used.
1. BreadBasket_DMS.csv
<br>This dataset is transactional data from a bakery. It is used in market basket analysis with apriori.
2. new_books.csv and ratings.csv
<br>These datasets are used for collaborative filtering, content based, and hybrid.
<br>We got them from https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k
<br>As the data is not clean enough and not meet our expectation, we cleaned the data first. You can see the code in folder Data Preparation.
